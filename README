What is aware?

aware is a PHP monitoring system that supports storing PHP errors (events) into different storage backends. 
The events can be later retrieved from backends that support retrieval.

How does it work?

Roughly: override zend_error_cb, set_error_handler and restore_error_handler with a custom function that takes 
a copy of the current context and sends the error to the backend. The backend storage is abstracted from away 
and each backend storage is a separate PHP extension. The backend will receive a zval * containing information 
about the current error which it usually serializes and stores based on it's own configuration. 

Currently it is possible to chain the backends to allow configurations such as store the event to 
tokyo tyrant and send snmp trap as well.


So the cycle is a about the following:

  1. Aware startup
    -> override zend_error_cb with interceptor and store a pointer to the original callback

  2. PHP error happens 
    -> engine calls zend_error_cb which brings the error message etc to our callback
      -> loop through all configured backends and pass the information 
        -> the backend (normally) serializes the event and stores based on it's config
    -> call the original error callback 


What does aware monitor?

  At the moment following things:
    - php errors 
    - slow requests
    - peak memory usage during request
    

How can I view the reports?

Use aware_event_get(string mod_name, string uuid) and aware_event_get_list(string mod_name[, int start, int limit]). 
There is a very simple GUI available in gui/ directory.
